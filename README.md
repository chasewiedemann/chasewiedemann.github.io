Hello!

I am currently a Ph.D. Student at Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis

I am in my first year, so my research interests are not fully developed. However, I broadly know that I am interested in IO, specifically around the Healthcare Industry.

Come back often for updates to my CV and Research!
