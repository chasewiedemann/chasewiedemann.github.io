Hello!

I am currently a Ph.D. Student attending Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis

I am now entering my 4th Year, and want to migrate my workflow onto Github, and specifically, onto this site. My goal is to create pages here for the projects I am working on, and keep up-to-date records of how those projects are going.
