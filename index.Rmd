# Hello! 

Welcome to my Personal Website. I am currently a 5th Year PhD student at Olin Business School- WUSTL. My main research focus is on how the supply of public goods can be affected by the organization of local government.  

A major application of my research is in local government mergers. 

My job market paper, which you can check out the most recent version of in Projects tab above,   

If you ever want to reach out to discuss my research or economics in general, please do! 

Cheers!

Chase Wiedemann
