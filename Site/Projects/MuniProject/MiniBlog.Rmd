# Inital Post

Created the subdirectories along with a template. Want to make sure this will all work!

# Getting to work

I have the site running where I want, lets get to some actual work. What do I want to do to start the replication? There should obviously be some sort of explanation about what I am doing before I get into code. So maybe I get some back ground on the Alonso Muth and Mills cbd model, bring in some stuff about the polycentric theory, and then talk about static subcenter identification. I can then point out where I think the issues are with that, and introduce dynamics into the identification problem. 

Once thats all done, I think I want to try using the API. Thats probably not something I would have done if I wasnt doing this on the page, but isn't that the point of the page?

## Some Thoughts

The replication is getting pretty stream of consiousness as well. That was supposed to be reserved for the blog and mini-blog. But I think I am figuring out the difference. The Replicaiton can be editted, while the blogs cannot. So while I can go back and edit the absolute garbage that is in the replication page right now as I get a better idea of the direction of the project, I should be keeping the blog and mini-blogs as a constant stream. I also realized that I need to do more site editing. But Ill describe that in the big blog.
