# Abstract

# Intro 2

The winners and losers of economic competition are not evenly distributed across geographic space. This holds, almost as a rule, regardless of the scope in which the geographic space is defined. Starting with the scope of the national economy, at any point in time, competition between urban areas bestows economic growth on the winners while leaving economic stagnation or even decay to the losers. Viewing a single urban area, the same can be said of the many municipalities that make up the urban area: the most competitive of the municipalities receive the bulk of the good fortune, while the less competitive are left behind. This multitude of outcomes within a scope presents interesting incentives and welfare calculations: a municipalities fortune is tied not only to its competitive position among the municipalities in its urban area, but also to the competitive position of its urban area within the national market.

Any intervention considered in the municipal market must then account for incentives on both levels of competition. Consider an often debated policy instrument, municipal mergers. Advocates of mergers claim that the merging parties will gain access to greater economies of scale, but the effect of changing the competitive position of the urban area is often left unexamined. This could be seen as a cause for the lack of normative implications from that literature.  

Incorporating the effect on the urban area into policy prescriptions requires estimates of the future competitive environment both with and without the counterfactual merger. In this paper, we examine a model of urban area competition which allows us to directly estimate the former quantity from firms locational choices. Due to agglomeration forces, a firms optimal locational choice is determined through the joint process of all firms making locational choices. As locational decisions represent a large fixed investment, implicit in each firms optimization problem is a prediction regarding future states of urban areas. Further, these beliefs are self-reinforcing as expectations regarding optimal locations elicit behavior that makes those locations more optimal. Examining these locational choices allows us to infer what firms expect the future competitive environment of the urban area market to be. Having estimated these predictions, we can then preform a decomposition regarding municipal structure. If different competitive structures for municipalities have an effect on the future states of urban areas, this effect should be present in firms predictions. The decomposed relationship between municipal structure and urban area competitiveness can then be added to the policy prescription regarding possible municipal mergers.

To solve for firms expectations, we employ the Oblivious Equilibrium (OE) approach from Weintraub, Benkard, \& Van Roy (2008) and model a firms location as a state variable and its action as its decision to either to stay in the current location, exit the current location, or to enter into a new location given that it has not already entered. This approach ties closely with the economic problem at hand and handles the large state space inherent with modeling all firms and all locational choices. Both advantages are most easily seen in comparison to an alternative solution concept, Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE). Within the context of this problem, an MPE would maintain that all firms are able to form best responses against all other firms in the market. In our modeling context of locational choice, the market is national, meaning that firms would need to compute a best response in regards to every firm in the United States.  In comparison, the OE approach only requires that firms only have knowledge of the amount of firms in their own location and the stationary equilibrium number of firms of the urban area market. This is directly compatible with our current context, as the stationary equilibrium of the urban area market can be seen as a both a motivation for and a consequence of firms locational decisions. The computational advantages stem from a identical argument. Further, the more recent work of Weintraub, Benkard, \& Van Roy (2010) and Adlakha, Johari \& Weintraub (2013) point to the strong connection between these two equilibrium concepts. Given two conditions, which are exceedingly met in our context, the OE solution well approximates the full MPE solution.
