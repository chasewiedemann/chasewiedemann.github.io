# Abstract

# Introduction

The geographic structure of the economy can be seen as a self-replicating system. At the highest level, we consider the global economy, where large economic groups like the EU or NAFTA compete. If we zoom in one level, this process repeats. Instead of looking at global competition, we now focus on how countries within these groups compete against each other. This layered structure creates complex incentives: a country’s success depends not only on its own performance but also on the performance of its entire economic group. According to the First Welfare Theorem, competition among countries leads to a Pareto efficient outcome. The Second Welfare Theorem allows for selection of the most efficient Pareto outcome for the benefit of the whole group. These assumptions hold true only if there are no market inefficiencies.

This paper examines two levels deeper into this structure. The first additional level shifts the focus from competition between countries to competition among urban areas within a country. Here, the same results apply, along with the assumption about market inefficiencies. According to the First Welfare Theorem, competition among urban areas will result in a Pareto efficient allocation. The Second Welfare Theorem, conceptually implemented by the federal government, allows for choosing the most efficient allocation from a national perspective through transfers. The second level of analysis looks even closer, focusing on competition between municipalities within an urban area.

We make three key assumptions. First, we assume that there are no market inefficiencies, except potentially at the municipal level, which is the focus of this study. Second, we assume that there are no market inefficiencies in other urban areas outside the one we are studying. Third, we assume that we are close and below the Pareto optimal allocation that would exist without any market inefficiencies. This assumption allows us to consider any interventions in the studied urban area as improvements that can increase welfare without negatively impacting other urban areas or the country overall.

Since we are allowing for market inefficiencies at the municipal level, we must consider how likely these inefficiencies are. Certain features of municipalities suggest that such inefficiencies can occur. First, municipal budgets must legally be balanced. Second, municipal boundaries are generally fixed at the time of incorporation and rarely change. Third, municipalities typically do not have the option to exit the market. Fourth, municipalities compete with one another within a specific geographic space. Considering these factors, we can identify two situations where market inefficiencies may arise at the municipal level.

First, consider a high-quality municipality. Its appeal attracts firms and residents, expanding its tax base and allowing it to further improve its quality. This cycle can lead to high demand for land, but because the municipality's boundaries are fixed, its population may become limited by factors like congestion or residents' preference for less density. Despite these limitations, the increasing demand for land boosts the municipality’s tax revenue. The requirement for a balanced budget forces the municipality to spend this extra revenue, sometimes on low-return projects. From the broader urban area's perspective, this is a market inefficiency. Investing in low-return projects is not optimal, and according to the Second Welfare Theorem, these extra funds should ideally be allocated to projects outside the municipality to achieve the best overall resource allocation.

Second, consider a municipality that, due to its lower quality or the locational choices of other municipalities, experiences a decline in its population of residents and firms. This decline can create a negative cycle, depending on the economies of scale in municipal quality. If there is an inverted U-shaped relationship, a decrease in size might move the municipality closer to an efficient scale, reducing inefficiency. However, if the municipality is already at or below the efficient size, further decline only makes it less efficient. In this scenario, the municipality has land but cannot use it effectively due to its low quality, representing another type of market inefficiency.

These two scenarios suggest a possible solution: transferring excess funds from high-quality municipalities to lower-quality ones. This approach would ensure that high-quality municipalities invest only in high-return projects, while low-quality municipalities receive the resources they need to improve their quality and reach an efficient scale of residents and firms. We now make our fourth assumption. Transfers of this type are politically unfeasible. This is not an assumption without support. Enacting such a program would be undesirable from the residents and firms of the high quality municipality. This group can typically be assumed to carry more political cache than the group representing the low quality municipalities. 

One may ask why we cannot let a regulator of the urban area enforce such transfers, a role that we assumed the federal government would provide in the case of urban area competition. One practical, but not entirely satisfactory, reason is that urban areas do not always have access to such a regulator, as they often cross the predefined political boundaries of states and counties. A second, more fundamental issue is if a program of this type should even exist. A program attempting to implement such transfers would reduce incentives for the efficient production of quality in the high quality municipalities. There are also concerns about moral hazard, as transfers could incentivize poor management and reliance on the transfers. Further, a program of this type could entice residents and firms from high quality municipalities to exit the urban area all together. This is consistent with assumptions made, as the in flux of new, formally from a high quality municipality, residents and firms to an different urban area would represent a welfare improvement to that urban area. 

As we have ruled away transfers as an intervention, we can now look to alter the institutional details that lead to the market inefficiency. To begin, we could allow municipalities to run surpluses and deficits. This alleviates the issue of high quality municipalities spending on low return projects, but raises the question of what will happen to those funds if they are not being used. Abstracting from the nefarious, corruption, solution, we could imagine that these funds would be placed into some reserve, allowing the municipality a safeguard against future risk. But this risk mitigation can be directly converted into municipal quality, as residents and firms desire a municipality that is able to protect their investment from negative shocks. This results in the same market inefficiency, but instead of spending on low return projects, municipalities are spending on inefficient risk mitigation.

On the other side, allowing low quality municipalities to run deficits would allow for additional quality production. However, every additional borrowed dollar contributes to the physical production of quality, but also offsets that quality with an increase in risk. This creates an adverse selection problem, as only the least risk adverse firms and residents will be willing to invest in a leveraged municipality. This leads to a municipality that is highly unresistant to negative shocks, which can also be viewed as a market inefficiency.  

Allowing expanded jurisdictions along with municipal exit could solve the market inefficiencies, but is unlikely to work given the spatial nature of municipal competition, something we unfortunately cannot alter. To see this, we can view the problem simply as high quality municipalities not possessing enough land, and low quality municipalities possessing too much. A land trade between the two would work like a cash transfer, and represent a solution to the market inefficiency. The spatial dimension of competition in the urban area can hampers this process. Further, spillover effects make this coincidence of wants even less likely. The spatial dimension of competition refers to the fact that the municipalities interact on a geography. A reasonable restriction to place on municipalities expanding their jurisdictions would be that they must remain connected. So to make the market inefficiency correcting trade as above, we would require a space constrained high quality municipality to share a boundary with a space-overwhelmed low quality municipality. Spillover effects make this situation unlikely. Consider the first situation above, the high quality municipality's spending on projects creates amenities and a pool of wealthy consumers that are not easily excluded from residents and firms of nearby municipalities. As this investment spills over into neighboring municipalities, their quality increases, isolating the high quality municipality from a low quality merge partner. 

Now consider the second situation. The low quality municipality is losing residents and firms. Neighboring municipalities have a marginally more difficult time attracting firms because they could locate to a similar municipality that neighbors a municipality with wealthy residents. They also have a marginally more difficult time attracting residents because again, they could locate in a similar municipality that neighbors a municipality with high amenities. This also has the effect of isolating the struggling municipality from a merge partner.

Aside from the improbability of the spatial layout of the urban area facilitating such a land trade, there are additional concerns that this might introduce a new market inefficiency. Creating allowing a high quality municipality to expand its borders does not guarantee that it will become more efficient. Taken to its logical extreme, without some dis-economies of scale the efficient solution would be to simply merge the entire urban area into a single municipality. By allowing high quality municipalities to grow ever larger, we may introduce a new market inefficiency as municipalities pass their optimal level of scale.

Taking the assumptions above that rule out other interventions, we find that our policy levers are close to exhausted. Remaining interventions involve either merging smaller municipalities together in an attempt to allow them access to economies of scale, or breaking up larger municipalities into the optimally sized parts. We will again assume that the second of those options is politically unfeasible. This leaves us with examining municipal mergers.  

Municipal mergers, the process of merging two or more political jurisdictions in an urban area, are often discussed in economic planning initiatives. Advocates of municipal mergers rely on the expected benefits from access to greater economies of scale and more effective regional planning. Detractors counter these claims with the perceived negative effects of decreased constituent attachment to the political process and increased costs stemming from bureaucracy. A large academic literature has tried to add to this debate by investigating past municipal mergers. This literature has lead to mixed results. The difficulty in extracting policy implications from past mergers are both empirical and theoretical. 

On the empirical side, examining past mergers presents two main challenges. First and foremost, municipal mergers are relatively rare events, making empirical estimates drawn from them subject to high variance. Second, mergers happen in an array of different cultural, political, and historic contexts, making external validity a concern when extrapolating results into a specific context. 

On the theory side, we are presented with three main challenges. First, municipal mergers do not occur in a vacuum, but rather inside a larger urban area. A counterfactual merger changes the incentives and the competitive environment for all residents, firms, and municipalities located in the urban area. Second, dynamics in the form of forward-looking agents play an immense role as the counterfactual merger can induce changes to established investment patterns, which is presumably the desired result of the merger. Third, a workable measure of welfare is often difficult to establish in these settings, making comparative statics or the answers to normative questions about pursuing municipal mergers difficult to come by.

If the goal is to extract normative policy prescriptions regarding mergers, these issues must be addressed. The proposed solution in this paper is to embed the framework of municipal mergers into a structural model of an urban area. Just as counterfactual mergers between competitive firms in a product market have been examined, we can examine counterfactual mergers of competitive municipalities in the market for residents and firms. To see the utility of this approach, we can examine how a structural model can be used to address the potential flaws discussed above.

We first start with the theoretical hurdles the model allows us to overcome. As a model of the entire urban area, the incentives of municipalities, residents, and firms are endogenous. This allows agents the opportunity to re-optimize after the counterfactual merger, which lets the new competitive environment of the urban area determine counterfactual allocation decisions. This re-optimization plays directly into the second hurdle the model overcomes. The choice of municipality for firms and residents is associated with large fixed costs. This means that agents are going to make decisions that not only rely on the current period allocations, but also on all subsequent periods. Finally, embedding a structural model allows us to examine welfare at the level of the urban area, instead of just at the municipal level. This relates directly to the stated belief that municipal mergers are a form of more effective regional planning, and also has interesting political economy ramifications. Who wins and who loses for a proposed municipal merger? How will the merger effect the urban area as a whole?

On the empirical side, the structural model allows us to simulate a merger without the need to have observed a merger in the data. As the incentives of our agents are recovered as model primitives, the outcome of a counterfactual merger is just the result of these agents optimizing in a new competitive environment. Because the model is estimated using data from the urban area of interest, it is self contained. While we may not have external validity globally, this encapsulation allows us to claim at least locally validity. 

Two broadly defined primitives of the model will drive the results and policy prescriptions of the model. First, primitives governing the municipal production function will determine how a municipality will be able to map their tax revenue into municipal quality. Following the literature, we expect that this will result in an inverted U-shaped curve, where the peak of such a curve can be thought of as the "optimal" municipal size. Second, substitution patterns for both residents and firms will dictate how agents re-optimize post-merger.
