# Introduction

When working in Urban Economics, we unsurprising focus on Urban areas. But what is an Urban area? We tend to take this as some predefined object, such as a MSA, a group of countys, or whatever level of data that we have. The goal of this paper is to let the data identify what an Urban Area should be, and really to go beyond that. 

For a long time, and still somewhat currently, the workhorse model of urban economics was the Alonzo-Mills-Muth Model of the Central Business District (CBD). What that theory says is that all urban areas are built around CBD's which are historically the major city that has been around the longest. So the St. Louis CBD would be centered by the city of St. Louis and the surrounding area would fall into the urbn area around that CBD. 

What do CBD's do? Well they produce. A standard model would have the assumption that all people living in the urban area work in the CBD. These workers can only access utility through working in the CBD (Maybe you normalize the utility of work outside the CBD to zero). A common assumption would also be that workers are symmetric, so that they all have to get the same utility.
