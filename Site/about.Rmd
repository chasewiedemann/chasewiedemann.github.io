The goal for this site is a open and realtime look into my research.

What does that look like? I don't know. But here's what I am imagining as I start.

There are three main goals here: Hosting my Work, Learning About Others Work, and Learning How to Work. Let's start with my work.

## Hosting My Work

The basic unit I'll be working on is a Project. I usually have two or three Projects going on at a time. Each Project has four main ingredients.

- Working Paper
- Working Slides
- Replication
- Diary

The first two are what are typically considered academic research output, i.e. the working paper and the working slides.

The next two ingredients, in my opinion, are the most interesting. A lot of work goes into making the other two ingredients, but that is generally a background process that is unstructured and unseen. The goal of the third and fourth ingredients are to document this process. 

I envision the third ingredient working as a very informal replication package.
